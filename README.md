# Generate-Emails
This script generates emails (but doesn't send them) regarding vaccine bills currently (January 2020) in the NYS Senate Health Committee. I will likely flesh it out more and add functionality if people use it, but it's pretty basic right now.

You need to have Python3 (NOT Python2!) installed to run this script. Follow instructions on the official Python website.

Once you have Python3 installed, just double click to run the script.
You will be prompted for a name, which is used as the signature at the bottom of each email. Then the emails will be created with whatever email client you have set as your default. I have only tried it with Windows Mail and Thunderbird, but there's no reason why it shouldn't work with Outlook as well.
If the emails look good, go ahead and send them.
